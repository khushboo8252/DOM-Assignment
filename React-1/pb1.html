1. What is React?
Ans- React is a JavaScript library that specializes in helping developers build user interfaces or UIs.
     In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars, 
     buttons and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app.
     Before React Js, developers were stuck building UIs by hand with "Vanilla Jvascript" (developer speak for
     the raw JavaScript language on its own)  or with less UI-focused React predecessors like Query. 
      
 


2.Who made React?
Ans- React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was inspired by 
     the functional programming language Lips and sought to create a library that would allow developers 
     to create  reusable components that could be easily combined to build complex user interfaces.

     React was initally used to build the Facebook news feed and was later released as an open-source project.
     It quickly gained traction within the developer community due to its simplicity and flexibility.





 3.What is Babel?
 Ans- Babel is a toolchain is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible
      version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can 
      for you.



4.How does Babel convert html code in React into valid code?
Ans- 1. A user can essentially use future javascript in the browser of today thanks to babel
        a very well-known transpiler.
     2. The standard method has the ability to accurately translate the newest javascript code into a format 
        that the browser can properly understand.
     3. Babel is a key tool that can translate JSX syntax, which is used to create HTML like code in React components
        into valid javascript code that can be executed in preferred browsers.
     4. By converting the JSX code into javascript functions that return the same HTML like structures.
     5. The functionality then enables the usage of JSX in React apps and ensures compatibility with outdated
        browsers that might not support the most recent javascript syntax.
        
        

5. What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example?
Ans- ReactDOM is like a bridge between React elements and actual DOM elements. Its job is to 
take the React elements and turn them into real DOM elements that get rendered on the page.

const reactRoot = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)
reactRoot.render(element)


6. What are the packages that you need to import for react to work with?
Ans- React ( or any other front-end framework) is an extremely powerful tool to  master. When it comes to 
     building front-end interfaces. React is hands down a huge time-saver for development teams and individuals.
     npm packages are paramount when it comes to developer productivity and happiness.

     1. React Testing :-
     The React Testing Library is a lightweight solution for testing React components. The Library provides 
     light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/react-utils.

     2. Installation:-
     This module is distributed via npm packages.
     yarn add --dev @testing-library/react
    


7.How do you add react to a web application?
Ans- I can do this in two steps:
1. Set up a javascript environment that lets you use the JSX syntax, split your code into modules with the 
 import/ export syntax and use package (for example, React) from the npm package registry.
2. Render your React components.



8. What is React.createElement?
Ans- In Vanilla javascript, you'd interact directly with the DOM elements using the document API. you don't do this.
Instead, you deal with React elements. We use createElement method from react to createReact elements.
1. One such property is the $$typeof which is a symbol indicating it's a valid React element.
2. The props object is where most of your data will reside, it contains properties you define including children.

const element = React.createElement("div",{
    className: "container",
    children: "Carpe Diem",
})
console.log(element)
 


9.What are the three properties that createElement accept?
Ans- Following are the properties of createElement accept:-
1. type: The type you have passed.
2. props: The props you have passed except for ref and key. If the type is a component with legacy
   type.defaultProps, then any missing or undefined props will get the values from type.defaultProps.
3. ref: The ref you have passed. If missing null.




10. What is the meaning of render and root?
Ans- Render:-  
     In React, Render is the technique that can redirect a page with the help of function render().
     Most importantly, render a function we can use to define the HTML code within the HTML element.
     It helps to display certain views in the UI using certain logic defined in the render function 
     and returns to output.

     Root:-
     In React, the root element refers to the top-level element that is the parent of all other 
     components in your application. It is typically represented as a DOM node within the public/index html 
     file that serves as the entry point for your React app.
